# bucketlist
Bucketlist, a SwiftUI-based application, enables users to pin their preferred destinations on a map. Additionally, it offers information about the closest well-known landmarks and notable events in the vicinity of the pinned location. The app relies on Wikipediaâ€™s API to fetch data for the nearest landmark.
